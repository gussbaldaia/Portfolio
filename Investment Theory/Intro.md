***FEBRUARY, 2023***

<h2 align="left">Summary:</h2>
This project involves analyzing the performance of 30 different companies over a 32-year period (1990-2022). The analysis aims to evaluate how past performances of these companies influence their short-term and long-term futures. The methodology includes a recursive portfolio approach, creating 5 portfolios with selected companies that are regularly updated and rebalanced based on past performances. Various performance measures and financial models such as CAPM, Fama-French 3-Factor, and Carhart models will be applied to the data for a comprehensive study. The ultimate goal is to draw accurate conclusions about the impact of past performances on the future of these assets.
