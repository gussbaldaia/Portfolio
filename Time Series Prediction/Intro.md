<h2 align="left">Summary:</h2>
This project focuses on analyzing a time series representing Alcoholic Beverages sales in the U.S. from January 2003 to December 2018. The dataset, obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank, consists of 193 monthly observations. The last 12 observations were excluded for prediction accuracy testing. The analysis involves an initial observational study, followed by the application of three different approaches: exponential smoothing, decomposition, and the ARIMA model. The goal is to determine the most accurate method for forecasting future observations by comparing the results of the exponential smoothing and ARIMA models.
