<h2 align="left">Abstract:</h2>

*Cork has become the preferred choice for sealing wine bottles, especially in high-quality wines produced from France, Italy, Spain, or Portugal. Due to cork stoppers' strong reputation in the wine industry, there is a substantial emphasis on ensuring efficient systems that guarantee both production capacity and product quality. This project, in collaboration with Amorim Cork S.A., proposes an online system to address the limitations related to human errors and effectiveness constraints faced by the existing human-dependent control system. The system should be able to identify anomalous behaviours from the state-of-the-art NDTech technology, a complex non-destructive gas chromatography screening system designed to detect undesired components, particularly TCA, in cork stoppers, from Amorim Cork S.A. The objective is to establish whether abnormal behaviour can be detected in real-time from NDTech operations, improving the existing control system. An LSTM autoencoder was chosen for its suitability with the sequential and unsupervised data provided by NDTech 2.0 operation. In this report, was conducted a thorough analysis of the data, including a comprehensive study of intentionally induced malfunctions simulations under a controlled environment. Through the utilization of the reconstruction error from the optimized trained models and the implemented adaptive threshold, it’s possible to determine whether each instance falls within the normal operation. The model’s performance under the controlled simulations were overall positive, where they could identify anomalies within most of the malfunctions. However, due to the absence of labels it was not possible to conclusive extrapolate this performance to the online tests. To support the team on-site with real-time information regarding the anomaly detection results, a conceptual visualization tool was introduced. This tool has potential to be instrumental in verifying the accuracy of detected anomalies and enabling a more proactive response from the team to promptly address potential issues.*
